## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which categories get the highest reviews from amongst the 10 most popular categories?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot visualizing the distribution of sentiment polarity, split by content rating.
- üîé **Analyze**: What impact does the content rating an app receives have on its sentiment and rating?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working for an app developer. They are in the process of brainstorming a new app. They want to ensure that their next app scores a high review on the app store, as this can lead to the app being featured on the store homepage. They would like you analyze what factors increase the rating an app will receive. They would also like to know what impact reviews have on the final score.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
