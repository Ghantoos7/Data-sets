## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which age groups send more SMS messages than make phone calls?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot visualizing the number of distinct phone calls by age group. Within the chart, differentiate between short, medium, and long calls (by the number of seconds).
- üîé **Analyze**: Are there significant differences between the length of phone calls between different tariff plans?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You have just been hired by a telecom company. A competitor has recently entered the market and is offering an attractive plan to new customers. The telecom company is worried that this competitor may start attracting its customers.

You have access to a dataset of the company's customers, including whether customers churned. The telecom company wants to know whether you can use this data to predict whether a customer will churn. They also want to know what factors increase the probability that a customer churns.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
