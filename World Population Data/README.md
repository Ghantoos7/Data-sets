**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which countries have experienced the highest population growth?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot that visualizes the population growth of countries over time grouped by region.
- üîé **Analyze**: How does income group affect a country's population growth?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working for a regional organization in East Asia and the Pacific that analyzes population statistics and makes recommendations to relevant governments. There are concerns that some countries in the region are experiencing a decline in populations. 

Your manager has asked you to prepare a population forecast for the region for 5, 10, and 15 years into the future. They have also asked you to identify the five countries with the lowest population growth (or greatest decline), and perform similar forecasts for these five countries individually.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions
