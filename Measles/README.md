## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: What types of schools have the highest overall and mmr vaccination rates?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot that visualizes the overall and mmr vaccination rates for the ten states with the highest number of schools.
- üîé **Analyze**: Does location affect the vaccination percentage of a school?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working for a public health organization. The organization has a problem: this year, the overall vaccination rate information for schools is not yet available. To gain an initial idea of the rates, your manager has asked you whether it is possible to use other data to predict the overall vaccination rate of a school. This includes such information as the mmr vaccination rate, the location, and the type of school. Your manager also wants to know how reliable your predictions are.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
