## Don't know where to start? 

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: How much variety exists in Netflix's offering? Base this on three variables: `type`, `country`, and `listed_in`.
- üìä **Visualize**: Build a word cloud from the movie and TV shows descriptions. Make sure to remove stop words!
- üîé **Analyze**: Has Netflix invested more in certain genres (see `listed_in`) in recent years? What about certain age groups (see `ratings`)?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

A talent agency has hired you to analyze patterns in the professional relationships of cast members and directors. The key deliverable is a network graph where each node represents a cast member or director. An edge represents a movie or TV show worked on by both nodes in this undirected graph. You can limit the actors to the first four names listed in `cast`. The client is interested in any insights you can derive from your Netflix network analysis, such as actor/actor and actor/director pairs that work most closely together, most popular actors and directors to work with, and graph differences over time.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.
