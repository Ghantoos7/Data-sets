## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which index has produced the highest average annual return?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot visualizing a 30 day moving average for an index of your choosing.
- üîé **Analyze**: Compare the volatilities of the indexes included in the dataset.

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working for an investment firm that is looking to invest in index funds. They have provided you with a dataset containing the returns of 13 different indexes. Your manager has asked you to make short-term forecasts for several of the most promising indexes to help them decide which would be a good fund to include. Your analysis should also include a discussion of the associated risks and volatility of each fund you focus on.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
