## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Negative order quantities indicate returns. Which products have been returned the most?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot visualizing the profits earned from UK customers weekly, monthly, and quarterly.
- üîé **Analyze**: Are order sizes from countries outside the United Kingdom significantly larger than orders from inside the United Kingdom?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working for an online retailer. Currently, the retailer sells over 4000 unique products. To take inventory of the items, your manager has asked you whether you can group the products into a small number of categories. The categories should be similar in terms of price and quantity sold and any other characteristics you can extract from the data.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
