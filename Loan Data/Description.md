## Don't know where to start? 

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**
 
- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Generate a correlation matrix between the numeric columns. What columns are positively and negatively correlated with each other? Does it change if you segment it by the purpose of the loan?
- üìä **Visualize**: Plot histograms for every numeric column with a color element to segment the bars by `not_fully_paid`.
- üîé **Analyze**: Do loans with the same purpose have similar qualities not shared by loans with differing purposes? You can consider only fully paid loans.

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You recently got a job as a machine learning scientist at a startup that wants to automate loan approvals. As your first project, your manager would like you to build a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid back based on this data. There are two things to note. First, there is class imbalance; there are fewer examples of loans not fully paid. Second, it's more important to accurately predict whether a loan will not be paid back rather than if a loan is paid back. Your manager will want to know how you accounted for this in training and evaluation your model.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.
