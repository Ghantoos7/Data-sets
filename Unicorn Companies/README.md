## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- 🗺️ **Explore**: Which investors are the most represented in the dataset?
- 📊 **Visualize**: Create a plot that visualizes the valuation of a company by the date it was added. Add annotations to outliers indicating the names of the company.
- 🔎 **Analyze**: Do the number of investors a company have correlate with its valuation?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You have been hired as a data scientist for a company that invests in start-ups. Your manager is interested in whether it is possible to predict whether a company reaches a valuation over 5 billion based on characteristics such as its country of origin, its category, and details about its investors.

Using the dataset provided, you have been asked to test whether such predictions are possible, and the confidence one can have in the results.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
