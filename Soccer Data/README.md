## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: What team commits the most fouls?
- üìä **Visualize**: Plot the percentage of games that ended in a draw over time.
- üîé **Analyze**: Does the number of red cards a team receives have an effect on its probability of winning a game?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You have just been hired as a data analyst for a local soccer team. The team has recently signed on some junior players and wants to give them as much experience as possible without losing games. If the head coach could be confident in the outcome of a game by halftime, they would be more likely to give the junior players time on the field.

The coach has asked you whether you can predict the outcome of a game by the results at halftime and how confident you would be in the prediction. 

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
