## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which of the ten companies has the highest closing price based on the most recent data?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot that visualizes the closing price at the end of each month for the 10 tech stocks.
- üîé **Analyze**: Which of the ten companies have experienced the greatest percent increase in closing price over the course of their existence?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You have been hired as an analyst for a small investment firm. They currently specialize in commodities, focusing on coffee, cocoa, and sugar. However, they are now interested in expanding to technology companies. Your manager has asked you to explore the returns and volatilities of the ten stocks provided and contrast them with the three commodities they currently invest in. 

They also want you to recommend how tech stocks could be integrated into a portfolio with the existing commodities they invest in to minimize risk while gaining exposure to the new market.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
