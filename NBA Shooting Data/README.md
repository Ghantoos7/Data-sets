## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: At what range is each player most likely to score a shot?
- üìä **Visualize**: Plot the shots made by the X and Y position on the court. For each shot, differentiate between the four different players.
- üîé **Analyze**: Are players more likely to score a shot the closer they get to the basket?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

A university basketball team has hired you to use data to improve their performance. They want to know whether it's possible to use past data to provide tailored recommendations to players.

As a test, you have been provided with NBA shooting data for four players. The manager of the university team has asked you whether it is possible to provide data-driven recommendations for each player based on their likelihood of making a shot. You must also include how reliable your findings are, as well as advice for each player.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your steps, findings, and conclusions.
