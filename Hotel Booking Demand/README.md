## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which family sizes are associated with the highest cancellation rate?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot that visualizes the cancellation rates of different times of the year.
- üîé **Analyze**: Are bookings with longer lead times more likely to result in a cancellation?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

A chain of hotels has just hired you as a data analyst. They have noticed that the cancellation rate has risen in the past few years. This often leads to rooms that are left unrented for multiple days at a time.

Hotel management is interested in developing a model to predict the likelihood that a customer will cancel their reservation. If successful, this could be used to optimize their booking service and anticipate when cancellations will occur.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
