## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: What are the jobs of the people most likely to subscribe to a term deposit?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot to visualize the number of people subscribing to a term deposit by `month`.
- üîé **Analyze**: What impact does the number of contacts performed during the last campaign have on the likelihood that a customer subscribes to a term deposit?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You work for a financial services firm. The past few campaigns have not gone as well as the firm would have hoped, and they are looking for ways to optimize their marketing efforts.

They have supplied you with data from a previous campaign and some additional metrics such as the consumer price index and consumer confidence index. They want to know whether you can predict the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. The manager would also like to know what factors are most likely to increase a customer's probability of subscribing.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
