## Don't know where to start?

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: In which year and city did the Netherlands win the highest number of medals in their history?
- üìä **Visualize**: Create a plot visualizing the relationship between the number of athletes countries send to an event and the number of medals they receive.
- üîé **Analyze**: In which sports does the height of an athlete increase their chances of earning a medal?

**Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:**

You are working as a data analyst for an international judo club. The owner of the club is looking for new ways to leverage data for competition. One idea they have had is to use past competition data to estimate the threat of future opponents. They have provided you with a dataset of past Olympic data and want to know whether you can use information such as the height, weight, age, and national origin of a judo competitor to estimate the probability that they will earn a medal.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your steps, findings, and conclusions.
